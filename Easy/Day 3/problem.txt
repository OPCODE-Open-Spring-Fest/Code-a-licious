You are given the coordinates of the centers of two circles and their radii. Determine the number of intersections between two circles.

Input:
The first line of input contains 3 numbers x1, y1, r1, separated by a single space - coordinate of center of circle1 and it's radius.
Second line contains 3 numbers x2, y2, r2, separated by a single space - coordinate of center of circle2 and it's radius.

All numbers are real, do not exceed 10^9 modulo, and are specified with no more than 3 decimal places.

Output:
Output a single number, the number of intersection points. If the number of points is infinite, output âˆ’1.
