Previously, there existed a boy named Joey. Joey decided one day to go for his money. He continued as a result.
Joey kept walking till the light faded. A dragon was sleeping in this darkness. There were white stones all around the dragon.
Joey is aware that certain of those stones should be decorated in a way that the dragon will lie inside of them according to his knowledge. Following this, the dragon will be captured. 
Every stone has the potential to be either painted or unpainted.A convex polygon can be used to represent stones, while a set of points can form dragons.
The objective at hand is to determine the number of ways to paint stones in order to capture the dragon.

Input:
The first line of input contains two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 5000).
Each of the next n lines contains two integers x[i] and y[i] — the coordinates of the stones.
Each of the next m lines contain two integers u[i] and v[i] — the coordinates of the dragon.
--> (-10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i], u[i], v[i] ≤ 10^9).
It is guaranteed the coordinate of stones are given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order and no three points lie on the same line.
