You have n rectangles defined by their vertices:(0,0),(a[i],0), (a[i],b[i]), and (0,b[i]), along with a corresponding number x[i] for each rectangle. Your task is to 
select a subset of these rectangles to maximize the area of their union, while subtracting the sum of their respective x[i] values.

Note: There are no nested rectangles in the given set.


Input data
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) - the number of rectangles.
Each of the next n lines contains three integers a[i], b[i] and x[i] (1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ a[i] * b[i]).

Output data
Print the maximum value which you can achieve.
