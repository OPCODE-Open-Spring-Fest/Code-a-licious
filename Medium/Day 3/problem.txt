Joey, newly acquainted with the stock market, has chosen a preferred stock and engaged in trading it for a consecutive span of n days. Denoting the profit gained by 
Joey on the i-th day as ai, where ai<0 signifies a loss, Joey aims to determine the maximum profit he could have attained if he abstained from trading for exactly one
day.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
The next line denotes n integers ai (-100 <= ai <=100), denoting the profit earned by Joey on the i-th day.

Output:
For each test case, print on a new line the maximum amount of profit he would have earned, if he skipped trading for exactly one day.
